Here’s an R script that repeatedly generates a summary table based on motions, summaries, voting results, and councillors’ decisions. This script assumes that the data is provided in a structured data frame, and it will loop over the motions, creating a table for each.
Steps:

    Define the data in a data frame.
    Write a function that generates the summary for each motion.
    Loop through each motion and output the summary table.

r

# Step 1: Define the data frame with motions and councillors' decisions
motions_df <- data.frame(
  Motion = c("Approval of Minutes", "Approval of Order of Business", "By-law M-301 Amendment",
             "Appointment of Building Officials", "Cogswell District Project Update", 
             "Amendments to Administrative Order 29", "Canada Public Transit Fund Application", 
             "Cogswell District Land Use Policies", "Active Transportation Infrastructure"),
  
  Summary = c("Approval of minutes from August 20, 2024 Committee of the Whole and Regional Council",
              "Amending the order of business for the day’s agenda",
              "Adoption of By-law M-301, Amending By-law M-300 on Micromobility",
              "Appointment of Dane Ordway, KC Mangali, and Will Irvine as Building Officials",
              "Approve increase to Cogswell Interchange Redevelopment budget",
              "Adoption of proposed amendments to Administrative Order 29 on HRM Civic Addressing",
              "Submit an Expression of Interest for the Canada Public Transit Fund",
              "Consider requests of New Roots Halifax North End Community Land Trust in the Cogswell District Land Use Policies planning process",
              "Proceed with planning and stakeholder engagement for multimodal upgrades to Trunk 7"),
  
  VotingResults = c("Passed unanimously", "Passed unanimously", "14 in favour, 2 against",
                    "Passed unanimously", "Passed unanimously", "Passed unanimously", 
                    "Passed unanimously", "Passed unanimously", "Passed unanimously"),
  
  InFavour = c("All present councillors", "All present councillors", 
               "Mayor Savage, Deputy Mayor Deagle Gammon, Councillors Hendsbee, Purdy, Austin, Mancini, Mason, Smith, Cleary, Stoddard, Lovelace, Blackburn, Russell, Outhit",
               "All present councillors", "All present councillors", "All present councillors", 
               "All present councillors", "All present councillors", "All present councillors"),
  
  Against = c("None", "None", "Councillors Morse, Cuttell", "None", "None", "None", 
              "None", "None", "None"),
  
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Step 2: Define a function to generate a summary for each motion
generate_summary <- function(motion, summary, voting_results, in_favour, against) {
  cat("Motion:", motion, "\n")
  cat("Summary of the Motion:", summary, "\n")
  cat("Voting Results:", voting_results, "\n")
  cat("Councillors in Favour:", in_favour, "\n")
  cat("Councillors Against:", against, "\n")
  cat("------------------------------------------------------\n")
}

# Step 3: Loop through each motion and generate the summary
for (i in 1:nrow(motions_df)) {
  generate_summary(
    motion = motions_df$Motion[i],
    summary = motions_df$Summary[i],
    voting_results = motions_df$VotingResults[i],
    in_favour = motions_df$InFavour[i],
    against = motions_df$Against[i]
  )
}

Explanation:

    motions_df: The data frame that stores all the information about each motion, including the motion name, summary, voting results, councillors in favour, and councillors against.
    generate_summary: A function that prints the summary of each motion.
    For loop: Iterates through each row of the motions_df and prints the motion details using the generate_summary function.

This script will generate a summary for each motion in sequence. You can modify the data or the function to adjust the output format as needed..
