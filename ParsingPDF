Parsing text from a PDF using R involves reading the text with the `pdftools` package and then processing that text to extract the relevant information, such as motions, summaries, voting results, and the names of councillors who voted for or against the motions. Here’s a **detailed walkthrough** on how to do this.

### Step 1: Install and Load Required Packages

Before starting, make sure you have the `pdftools` and `stringr` packages installed. The `pdftools` package will help us extract text from the PDF, and `stringr` is useful for text manipulation with regular expressions.

```r
# Install the packages if you haven't already
install.packages("pdftools")
install.packages("stringr")

# Load the libraries
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)
```

### Step 2: Read the PDF

Use `pdftools` to extract the text from the PDF file.

```r
# Read the text from the PDF
pdf_text_data <- pdf_text("path_to_your_pdf_file.pdf")

# Print the text from the first page for exploration
cat(pdf_text_data[1])
```

### Step 3: Inspect and Understand the Raw Text

Before you start parsing, look at the raw text to understand how it's structured. You’ll likely see paragraphs of text, headings, and possibly repetitive patterns. Look for key phrases or patterns that can help you identify the sections of interest, such as:
- **"MOTION PUT AND PASSED"** for the end of a motion.
- **"Councillor"** for names of councillors.
- **Summaries** that typically come right after a motion title.

### Step 4: Extracting Relevant Sections

#### Example: Extracting Motions and Summaries

We can use regular expressions (`regex`) to identify the start and end of each motion. For example, motions may be identified by patterns such as the word "MOVED" and summaries might follow after.

```r
# Extract text for each page
page_text <- pdf_text_data[1]  # Extracting from the first page

# Split the page by newline characters into individual lines
lines <- unlist(strsplit(page_text, "\n"))

# Extract lines that contain the word "MOVED" (where motions start)
motion_lines <- grep("MOVED", lines, value = TRUE)

# Display the extracted lines containing motions
motion_lines
```

#### Example: Extracting Voting Results

Voting results might be accompanied by phrases like **"PUT AND PASSED"** or **"in favour"**. You can use regular expressions to find those lines.

```r
# Extract lines that contain the voting results (PUT AND PASSED)
voting_lines <- grep("PUT AND PASSED", lines, value = TRUE)

# Display the extracted voting result lines
voting_lines
```

### Step 5: Clean the Extracted Data

After extracting the raw text, you will often need to clean it by removing unnecessary characters, extra whitespace, or irrelevant sections. The `gsub()` and `str_trim()` functions are useful for this.

```r
# Example of cleaning up the text
cleaned_motion_lines <- str_trim(gsub("\\s+", " ", motion_lines))  # Remove extra whitespace
cleaned_voting_lines <- str_trim(gsub("\\s+", " ", voting_lines))  # Clean the voting lines

# View cleaned data
cleaned_motion_lines
cleaned_voting_lines
```

### Step 6: Structure the Extracted Data

Now that you have the key sections (motions, voting results, etc.), you can structure the data into a data frame for further analysis.

```r
# Create a data frame to store motions and their voting results
motion_df <- data.frame(
  Motion = cleaned_motion_lines,        # Motions
  VotingResults = cleaned_voting_lines, # Voting results
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# View the structured data
print(motion_df)
```

### Step 7: Parse Specific Details (Optional)

If you need to extract specific names of councillors who voted "for" and "against," you can search for specific patterns or keywords.

#### Extract Names of Councillors

If the councillors' names are listed under phrases like **"Councillors in favour"** or **"Councillors against"**, you can use regular expressions to isolate those sections.

```r
# Extract lines containing "in favour" or "against"
in_favour_lines <- grep("in favour", lines, value = TRUE)
against_lines <- grep("against", lines, value = TRUE)

# Clean and parse councillor names (e.g., names might be separated by commas)
in_favour_names <- unlist(strsplit(gsub(".*in favour: ", "", in_favour_lines), ","))
against_names <- unlist(strsplit(gsub(".*against: ", "", against_lines), ","))

# Trim white spaces
in_favour_names <- str_trim(in_favour_names)
against_names <- str_trim(against_names)

# Print councillors who voted in favour and against
print(in_favour_names)
print(against_names)
```

### Step 8: Automating the Process

If your PDF has multiple motions spread across different pages, you can loop through each page to extract and process all motions.

```r
# Initialize lists to store motions and voting results across all pages
all_motions <- list()
all_voting_results <- list()

# Loop through each page in the PDF
for (i in seq_along(pdf_text_data)) {
  page_text <- pdf_text_data[i]
  
  # Split the page text into lines
  lines <- unlist(strsplit(page_text, "\n"))
  
  # Extract motions and voting results
  motion_lines <- grep("MOVED", lines, value = TRUE)
  voting_lines <- grep("PUT AND PASSED", lines, value = TRUE)
  
  # Clean the extracted lines
  cleaned_motion_lines <- str_trim(gsub("\\s+", " ", motion_lines))
  cleaned_voting_lines <- str_trim(gsub("\\s+", " ", voting_lines))
  
  # Store in lists
  all_motions[[i]] <- cleaned_motion_lines
  all_voting_results[[i]] <- cleaned_voting_lines
}

# Convert the lists to data frames
motion_df <- data.frame(
  Motion = unlist(all_motions),
  VotingResults = unlist(all_voting_results),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# View the final structured data
print(motion_df)
```

### Step 9: Saving the Data

You can save the extracted and structured data into a CSV file for further analysis.

```r
# Save the structured data to a CSV file
write.csv(motion_df, "motions_voting_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### Summary of Steps:
1. **Read the PDF**: Use `pdf_text()` to extract text from the PDF.
2. **Inspect the Raw Text**: Understand the structure and patterns in the text.
3. **Extract Relevant Sections**: Use `grep()` or other string manipulation functions to isolate the parts of the text you need (motions, summaries, voting results).
4. **Clean the Data**: Use functions like `gsub()` and `str_trim()` to clean and process the extracted text.
5. **Structure the Data**: Organize the cleaned text into a structured format like a data frame.
6. **Automate and Process**: Loop through multiple pages and automate the extraction and structuring of data.
7. **Save the Data**: Export the processed data to a file (e.g., CSV).
