To publish tables like the ones generated in R to the web, there are several methods ranging from simple to more complex depending on your desired functionality. Below are a few options:

### 1. **Export to HTML and Publish**
   - **Generate HTML tables** from R and publish them on a static website or through platforms that support HTML.

### 2. **Use a Blogging Platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Wordpress)**
   - Many platforms like **WordPress** or **GitHub Pages** allow you to publish tables easily by embedding HTML.

### 3. **Interactive Dashboards with Shiny**
   - If you want to create **interactive dashboards** that allow users to filter, sort, or search through the data, you can use **Shiny** (an R web application framework).

### 4. **Google Sheets + Google Sites**
   - Export your R data to Google Sheets and embed it on a **Google Site** to create a simple web-based presentation.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Each Option

### Option 1: **Export to HTML and Publish on a Static Website**

#### Step 1: Convert the Data Frame to HTML in R

You can use the `knitr` package to generate HTML tables from your data frame:

```r
# Install knitr
install.packages("knitr")

# Load knitr library
library(knitr)

# Create the HTML table
html_table <- kable(meeting_data, format = "html")

# Save the HTML table to a file
write(html_table, "meeting_table.html")
```

#### Step 2: Host the HTML File
- You can host the generated HTML on any web hosting platform like **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or any server that serves HTML files.
- If you’re using GitHub Pages:
   1. Push the `meeting_table.html` file to a GitHub repository.
   2. Enable GitHub Pages from your repository settings, and your table will be available on the web.

### Option 2: **Publishing on a Blogging Platform (e.g., WordPress, GitHub Pages)**

#### For **GitHub Pages**:
1. Follow the same steps as **Option 1** to create your HTML file.
2. Push the HTML file to a GitHub repository.
3. Enable **GitHub Pages** in the repository settings to host the page.

#### For **WordPress**:
- **Method 1**: Copy the HTML table generated by `kable()` and paste it into a blog post:
  ```r
  # Generate HTML table and display in the console
  html_table <- kable(meeting_data, format = "html")
  cat(html_table)
  ```
  - Then paste the output into the HTML editor of WordPress.

### Option 3: **Interactive Dashboards with Shiny**

**Shiny** is a framework that allows you to build interactive web applications directly from R.

#### Step 1: Install Shiny

```r
install.packages("shiny")
```

#### Step 2: Create a Shiny App

Here’s an example Shiny app that displays your meeting data as an interactive table:

```r
library(shiny)

# Define UI for the Shiny App
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Halifax Regional Council Motions"),
  mainPanel(
    tableOutput("table")
  )
)

# Define server logic to render the table
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$table <- renderTable({
    meeting_data  # Use the data frame generated earlier
  })
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

#### Step 3: Host Your Shiny App

You can host your Shiny app online in a few ways:
- **ShinyApps.io**: This is a free service provided by RStudio for hosting Shiny apps.
  1. Sign up at [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/).
  2. Deploy your app using:
     ```r
     install.packages('rsconnect')
     rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='your_name', token='your_token', secret='your_secret')
     rsconnect::deployApp('path_to_your_shiny_app')
     ```

- **Self-hosting**: If you have your own server, you can host Shiny apps there as well.

### Option 4: **Google Sheets + Google Sites**

#### Step 1: Export Data to Google Sheets

You can use the `googlesheets4` package to upload your R data directly to Google Sheets.

```r
# Install googlesheets4 package
install.packages("googlesheets4")

# Load the package
library(googlesheets4)

# Authorize Google Sheets
gs4_auth()

# Create a new Google Sheet and upload data
sheet <- gs4_create("Halifax Regional Council Motions", sheets = list(data = meeting_data))
```

#### Step 2: Embed Google Sheets on Google Sites

1. Create a **Google Site** ([Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/)).
2. Use the **"Embed"** option in Google Sites to add the Google Sheets data (or simply embed a link to the Google Sheets table).

---

### Option 5: **R Markdown to HTML (Static or Interactive)**

#### Step 1: Create an R Markdown Document

R Markdown allows you to combine R code with text, tables, and other outputs to generate an HTML report.

1. Install the necessary packages:

   ```r
   install.packages("rmarkdown")
   ```

2. Create an R Markdown file:

   ```r
   ---
   title: "Halifax Regional Council Motions"
   output: html_document
   ---

   ```{r, echo=FALSE}
   library(knitr)
   kable(meeting_data)
   ```
   ```

3. Render the R Markdown file to HTML:

   ```r
   rmarkdown::render("my_report.Rmd")
   ```

#### Step 2: Host the HTML on a Platform

- You can host the generated HTML file on platforms like **GitHub Pages** or any static website host (as in **Option 1**).

### Additional Hosting Options:
1. **Netlify**: Great for hosting static HTML files. Just drag and drop your HTML folder to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for instant hosting.
2. **AWS S3**: If you are familiar with Amazon Web Services, you can host the HTML files on **Amazon S3**.
3. **WordPress Plugins**: You can use plugins like **TablePress** to add tables from CSV or Google Sheets directly to WordPress.

### Summary:
- **For static tables**: Export to HTML or Google Sheets and embed them in a website or blog.
- **For interactive tables**: Use **Shiny** or embed tables with filtering and sorting options.
- **For automated publishing**: Use **R Markdown** to HTML or deploy to a platform like **ShinyApps.io**.

Each method can suit different needs, depending on whether you want static or interactive tables. Let me know if you need help implementing any of these methods!
